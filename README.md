# Math Skills
## Statistical Analysis Tool

This project is a command-line tool written in Go that performs statistical analysis on numerical data read from a file. It calculates the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of the data and provides the results in a user-friendly format.

## About The Project
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient statistical analysis tool that can handle large datasets with ease. The tool is designed to read numerical data from a file, perform various statistical calculations, and display the results in a readable format.

## Getting Started

To get started with Math Skills, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites
- Go installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Go programming language.


### Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vincent-Omondi/math-skills.git
``` 

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd math-skills
```

## Usage

To use Math Skills, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a text file containing the dataset you want to analyze. Each line of the file should represent one value of the dataset.

2. Compile the program using the following command

```sh
go build
```
3. Run the compiled program with the file path as an argument

```sh
./math-skills <file_path>
```
Replace <file_path> with the path to the file containing the numerical data you want to analyze. The file should have one number per line, and non-numeric values and overflow will be ignored.
Example:
```sh
./math-skills data.txt
```

The program will output the statistics in the following manner (the following numbers are only examples)

```
User$ ./math-skills data.txt
Average: 147
Median: 146
Variance: 769
Standard Deviation: 28
```
All values are rounded to the nearest integer.

## RoadMap
* Add support for different input file formats (e.g., CSV, xlsx)
* Implement additional statistical measures (e.g., quartiles, percentiles)
* Enhance error handling and input validation
* Optimization for large datasets.
* Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience
