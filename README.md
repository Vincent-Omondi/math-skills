This repository hosts a project aimed at enhancing mathematical and statistical computation skills. The project focuses on calculating fundamental statistical measures including Average, Median, Variance, and Standard Deviation.


Your program is a good start towards handling the reading of data and computing statistical measures. However, there are several enhancements and corrections we can make to better align with best practices and the considerations outlined earlier. Let's go through some improvements and fixes.
Review and Enhancements
1. 
Error and Edge Case Handling

    Non-numeric Values: Your program stops and reports the first non-numeric value it encounters. Instead, it could skip non-numeric values and continue processing, or at least count them and report the total count at the end.
    Missing Values: You prompt the user for missing value imputation but only when there are missing values (""). A better approach might be to handle this more gracefully or automatically without user intervention for a batch process.
    Empty File: Good check for an empty file after reading, but consider checking if only non-numeric values were present.

2. 
Performance

    Sorting Algorithm: Using Bubble Sort is not efficient for large datasets. Consider using Go's built-in sort for better performance.

3. 
Precision and Rounding

    You are using floating-point arithmetic but rounding them to two decimal places in outputs. According to the task description, you should round results to the nearest integer for final output.

4. 
Numerical Stability

    Standard Deviation Calculation: Your StDev function seems to manually compute the square root using an iterative approach, which isnâ€™t numerically stable for all inputs and is unnecessary since Go provides math.Sqrt.

5. 
Output Format

    Ensure outputs are in the exact format required by the specification, which means rounding all outputs to the nearest integer and matching the case and structure exactly.

1. 
Data Format and Integrity

    Consistency: Ensure that every line in your input file contains exactly one integer. Your program should be robust enough to handle or report inconsistencies or unexpected data formats.
    Non-Numeric Values: Consider what should happen if the file contains non-numeric values. Should your program skip them, report an error, or halt execution?
    Empty Lines: Decide how your program will handle empty lines (ignore or treat them as errors).

2. 
Statistical Assumptions

    Population vs. Sample: Confirm that you are treating the data as a full population (not a sample from a larger population), as this affects the calculation of variance and standard deviation.
    Scale and Units: Understand the scale and units of the data (if applicable), although for pure numbers this might not change the computational approach, it's crucial for interpreting results.

3. 
Numerical Stability and Precision

    Floating Point Precision: Be aware of precision issues when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, especially if your data set is large or contains very large or very small numbers.
    Rounding: You are required to print rounded integers. Ensure that you use a consistent rounding method (e.g., round-half-up) throughout your calculations.

4. 
Performance and Scalability

    Large Files: If the data file is very large, consider the memory usage of your program. You might need to read the file in chunks if it does not fit into memory.
    Efficiency: Implement efficient algorithms for median, variance, and standard deviation to handle large datasets smoothly.

5. 
Edge Cases

    Single Data Point: Ensure your program can handle the case where the file contains only one data point (this affects variance and standard deviation).
    No Data Points: Decide how your program should behave if the file is empty (e.g., should it return an error or handle it gracefully?).

6. 
Output Format

    Formatting: Ensure that the output strictly follows the required format, as the testing will likely expect exact matches.
    Error Handling: Consider how your program outputs errors (e.g., to standard error) and how it exits in error conditions (exit codes).

7. 
File Handling

    Read Permission: Ensure your program gracefully handles the case where the file does not exist or is not readable.
    Argument Validation: Verify that the command-line arguments are valid and provide useful error messages if not.

Example Considerations in Practice

Here is a quick checklist based on the above considerations:

    Integrity Check: Before processing, verify all data is numeric.
    Edge Cases: Write tests or add checks for cases with 0, 1, and many numbers.
    Rounding: Use a library or function that supports consistent rounding.
    Performance: If testing with large numbers, check memory and efficiency; consider using generators or iterators if applicable.
    Output: Ensure that the output format is exactly as specified.
